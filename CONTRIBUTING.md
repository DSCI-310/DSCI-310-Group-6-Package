# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to this project! 
If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, 
please open up an issue [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-6-Package/issues).

The group members will contribute by working in a branhch-feature approach, meaning
each new feature or fix will be implemented and tested in its own branch and submitted
for peer review by a Pull Request before being incorporated into the main working branch.

If you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix, and you are not a group member, we encourage
you to fork our repository and submit your fix or new feature using a Pull Request. 
We will review pull requests within 7 days. 
All contributors must abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
